/*
Interfaces are slower in performance as compared to abstract classes as extra indirections are required for interfaces. Another key factor for developers to take into consideration is that any class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement many interfaces.

Use of interfaces also puts an extra burden on the developers as any time an interface is implemented in a class; developer is forced to implement each and every method of interface.

interface is that an interface can only possess declaration of public static methods with no concrete implementation.
a class which implements an interface must implement all the methods of the interface
A class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.
